# csk2020

This is a repository for the projects I made for the CS Kickstart program in 2020. 

Currently, this is the main feature of the python program:
* OWOBOT is a choose your own adventure inspired game. The program involves a storyline about a robot, OWOBOT, that will take over your computer unless you manage to beat it in three different levels. 
The levels are these three games: rock paper scissors, guess the number, and tic tac toe! :0
