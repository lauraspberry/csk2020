# csk2020

This is a repository for the project I made for the CS Kickstart program in August of 2020!

Currently, this is the main feature of the python program:
* OWOBOT is a choose your own adventure inspired game. The program involves a storyline about a robot, OWOBOT, that will take over your computer unless you manage to beat it in three different levels. 
The levels are these three games: rock paper scissors, guess the number, and tic tac toe! :0 
* I created the games within different files and functions, then imported them into the main game file. There are game loops within the individual games. 


Note: Some of this code will be refactored for the 2021 curriculum.
